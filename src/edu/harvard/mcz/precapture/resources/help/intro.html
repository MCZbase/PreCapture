<h1>Purpose of the Pre-Capture Application</h1>
<p>This application is designed to create human and machine readable labels to 
accompany containers of collection objects (Folders of Herbarium Sheets, 
Unit Trays of Insects, etc.) into a digitization apparatus where the machine
readable information can be extracted at the container level and applied to the
digital records of each of the contained collection objects.  The purpose of
this is to reduce redundant capture of information.  For example, all 
the herbarium sheets in a folder are likely to share a current filed under
identification.  An initial pre-data-capture pass through the collection can 
capture this current identification once, print it in machine readable form, and 
associate that printed information with the folder.  Thus, when that folder is 
brought to a station in a workflow, the machine readable information can be 
scanned and associated with the image and database record of each specimen 
in the folder, without the current identification having to be retyped for each 
sheet.  This concept of capturing information from the storage of collection 
objects prior to data capture and then applying the information to all collection 
objects from within a given container can be applied within any discipline 
where multiple collection objects sharing similar information are stored
in the same container.</p>
